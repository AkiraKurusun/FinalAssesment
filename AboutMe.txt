- I started seriously coding in 2019 when one of my teacher gave me a gift of a MicroBit. I had previously did multiple Hour of Code sponsored by my schools but i dont count these. My coding experience really took off when i took a clas my jounior year of high school on Python. I learned all the basics and some more complex libraries in python such as tkinter and pygame.
